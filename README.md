# etch-a-sketch_project

This will be my second JS project from TOP and it requires the use of DOM manipulation and event handling.
So far I used some methods in the previous project, RPS but I'm guessing it'll be more this time around.

# What I've learned and struggled with

With this project, I found it relatively easy to generate the grids via javascript and although the solution I came up
with to generate new grids when the button is clicked isn't the most efficient. I struggled a lot with scoping when coming
up with the functions.
Also when creating the random color grids, I repeated the function twice and that's inefficient and I will come back to
restructure my code again but as of now things are working.
The remaining issue is when I give the wrong input on the prompt, it asks me to give the correct input and even the correct
input doesn't reset the grid. So that needs fixing.
